# Welcome to the Izydog Project 🐶

Izydog is a mobile application designed for dog lovers, created by Jordan Torres with technical expertise contributed by Alan Santer. Our main goal is to provide an interactive experience for dog owners, helping them navigate the world of pet ownership more conveniently and informatively.

## 📋 Project Overview

Izydog offers an interactive map, similar to Waze, where users can report animal-related points of interest, such as poop bag dispensers, dog parks, veterinarians, and much more. Our app makes the lives of dog owners easier by helping them quickly find what they need while out and about with their four-legged companions.

## 🌐 Key Features

- **Interactive Map**: Explore a detailed map with information on nearby animal-related places and services.

- **Community Reporting**: Users can report unlisted areas directly from the application to continually improve our database.

- **Social Features**: Connect with other dog owners through features such as lost pet alerts and the ability to know if there are compatibility issues with other animals in the same area.

## 🤝 Contribute

You can contribute to improving Izydog by reporting areas or suggesting enhancements directly from the application. Your contribution will help make the experience even better for all users.
